# CSVExporter
A simple python script for exporting a CSV file into a mysql database or mysql based databases such as mariadb.
<b>Notes : <b>
 1. Csv file should contain header or the table you want to export data into should exists.
 2. If table does not exist, the script will create one based on the csv file titles (first row).
